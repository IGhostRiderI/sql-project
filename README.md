Developed a comprehensive SQL database for a fictional e-commerce company using Microsoft SQL Server. The project encompasses database creation, schema design with normalized tables (e.g., Customer, Orders, Items, Suppliers, Categories, and junction tables for many-to-many relationships), data insertion, and structural modifications via ALTER statements. Implemented two views (OrderView and ItemView) to streamline access to aggregated data from multiple tables, incorporating joins, concatenations, and conditional logic. Crafted advanced queries for business insights, including profit calculations, inventory analysis of unsold items, customer referral rankings, category interest levels, monthly order summaries, and customer spending reports using GROUP BY, ORDER BY, subqueries, CTEs, and aggregate functions. This initiative demonstrates proficiency in relational database management, query optimization, and data-driven reporting to support operational decision-making.
